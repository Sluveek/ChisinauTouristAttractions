## Purpose of the project:

 - The purpose of this project is to present the main attractions of Chisinau, along with some brief historical information and location details. It aims to give tourists an overview of the city's key points of interest.

## Home Page

 - The menu has links to the three pages in the project, to which I added a class to mark the page that is active by highlighting the name of the page in the menu.
 
 - I added a suggestive image from the city of Chisinau.

 - In the Tourist Information section I have added a brief history and information about the location.

 - In the footer section I have included links to social media.

## In Attraction Page

 - I have included tourist attractions with a small description of them from the city of Chisinau

## Feedback form page

 - I have put a form where visitors can give Feedback about other attractions
