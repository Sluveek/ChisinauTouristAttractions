        <p>The Valley of the Mills Park
          It is a park in the Buiucani district of the capital. It was established on the initiative of L. Brezhnev in
          1950 and was originally called “Central Park of Culture and Rest of the Leninist Commune”.
          The park is located on the shore of the Mill Valley Lake and covers an area of 114 hectares, the lake having
          an area of 34 hectares. The park was designed under the direction of the famous architect Robert Kurz.
          On the territory of the park there is a summer theatre – the Green Theatre, with a capacity of 5000 seats
          under the open sky, a day cinema, a children’s playground “Andries”, a beach, a boat station, etc.
          The lake park has served as a base for various water sports. Three rowing schools used to operate in the park.
          There were sports fields and fishing spots for amateurs. In winter, an urban ice rink was held on the lake
          ice. There was also a parachute jump tower.
          Next to the park is Moldova’s largest exhibition centre – Moldexpo.
          The park is also famous thanks to the rotunda and the Cascades Staircase, which were recently repaired. The
          Cascades Staircase consists of 218 steps and is longer than the famous General Potemkin Staircase in Odessa
          (which has 200 steps).</p>

        <p>The Chişinău State Circus was officially opened in 1981 and was, at the time, a top circus entertainment
          venue with state-of-the-art equipment and spaces for rehearsals, animals, and veterinarians. It had a capacity
          of 1,900 seats and the ring was over 40 feet across, making it the largest auditorium in Moldova. Circus
          artists would travel from near and far (Belarus, China, Finland, Germany, Russia, Ukraine etc.) to perform
          there, and at its peak, 57 concerts were held there in the space of a year.
          The Moldovan independence and the introduction of a market economy initially led to a rapid inflation
          resulting in a serious economic crisis. Still, today, Moldova is the poorest country in Europe, even though
          the economy has recovered and is growing steadily. Under these circumstances there was no room for a circus
          and the venue was abandoned in 2004.
          Luckily, a decade later, on the 30th of May, 2014, Circul came back to life. A long restoration process funded
          mainly by the Ministry of Culture had been going on for years and finally a smaller venue was opened in the
          building. There’s now room for 300 people sitting in the round, and features shows including clowns, gymnasts,
          acrobats, and exotic animals in classic circus fashion.
          After being forgotten for a decade the Chişinău State Circus is once again slowly waking to life, restoring
          its past glory and bringing joy and entertainment to a new generation of Moldovans.</p>

        <p>Stefan the Great
          The bronze monument of Stefan the Great (or Stefan cel Mare as it's known locally) outside the main entrance
          to the park bearing the same name in downtown Chisinau commemorates Moldova's national hero – the ancient
          ruler, who, in the 15th century, successfully defended the country from Turkish invasion. The statue was cast
          in Bucharest in the early 20th century and was intended to replace the monument to the Russian Emperor
          Alexander II which had previously stood in this place and was demolished by Romanian authorities after Moldova
          had joined the Romanian Kingdom in 1918.
          The sculpture was created by Alexandru Plamadeala who had traveled far and wide, prior to starting the job, in
          order to find a portrait of Stefan cel Mare. They say, the sculptor made three different copies of the
          monument, one of which stands today. Over the years, the sculpture has been moved several times from place to
          place. Shortly before the Soviet invasion of Bessarabia in 1940, it was taken to Vaslui in the eastern part of
          Romania, and then returned to Chisinau in 1942. Then, in 1944, it was once again dispatched to Romania.
          Finally, after a very long while, in 1989, the monument was restored in its original place in Chisinau. Today,
          the sculpture represents one of the top tourist sights in Moldovan capital and is a popular meeting point with
          locals, often visited by foreign guests, wedding couples and others</p>

        <p>Dendrarium Park was founded in 1973, however every year it becomes more and more modern due to the fact, that
          our government really strives to take good care of it. This place is very memorable and important for many
          residents of Chisinau. Many had their first kiss here and some even shared a wedding day together within this
          park. Everybody has its own story connected to Dendrarium Park. Let's find out why this park is so famous and
          if it's true that here you can find the most stunning roses of Chisinau.
          Dendrarium park is a favorite place for the locals to visit in their free time and on weekends. If you are our
          guest in Chisinau and decide to visit this park, you can even feed the ducks and swans! However, you should
          always remember to give them only bread. Other food is not welcomed, as it may irritate their tender digestive
          system. Here, you can also meet many tourists, not only in summer but also during other seasons. Even the
          students of nearby schools and colleges come here to study for exams, seminars, and even have their meetings
          in a natural setting! Dendrarium activities also include riding bikes, rollers, making picnics (although fire
          is prohibited), photo sessions, and other interesting things. Don't forget to take rackets for badminton or a
          ball to play with your friends on the well-groomed green grass. In the future, there are plans to add the golf
          terrain to Dendrarium. </p>

      <div class="attraction-content">
        <p>The cathedral was built in the 1830s to a Neoclassical design by Abram Melnikov (who had designed a similar
          church in Bolhrad). The cathedral was bombed during World War II, and its bell tower was destroyed by the
          local Communists in 1962. The new bell tower was constructed in 1997. During the Soviet period, worship was
          prohibited and the cathedral was transformed into an exhibition center.

          Melnikov's design is Neoclassical. The façade is very simple and clear with six Doric column for the entrance.
          Because of the numerous destructions which the cathedral suffered throughout time, the building has received
          several restorations and shifts in its shape. For instance, the current zinc dome and its cross at the top are
          both an addition from 1997 built over the previous structure. The inside was completely blank during the
          Soviet period but nowadays it has painted walls in pure Orthodox style.</p>
